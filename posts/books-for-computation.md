I have a long list of books I would like to read for 2021. This post will include some books that I have read myself (as a beginner) and some books that I have on my list because of others' suggestions. 

[Code - The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44882.Code?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=LlTCrHJBID&rank=1)

In my humblest opinion, I believe this book can be considered a **must-read** to gain understanding of how computers work. This book actually helped me *really* understand the stuff that I was taught in my college CS classes. 
> While the rest of the list is in no particular order, read this book first if you can. However, if your intention in learning computation is purely software and coding, this book might be a bit too much since it touches upon electronics a lot.

[Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code)

A popular book among programmers, this book will literally teach you the art of clean code. You can learn anything from bad code to good code, error handling, unit testing with this book.

[The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425208.The_Algorithm_Design_Manual)

Algorithms play a huge role in software engineering. The knowledge of designing and managing key algorithms can be gained through this book. While it has little depth to it, it is a great resource to revise algorithm fundamentals.

[The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52715562-the-pragmatic-programmer)

The core process of programming lies within this book: career development, architectural techniques, programming errors and more. Whether you are a newbie to programming or an expert, you can surely benefit from this book.

> That's all from me. I understand reading books is not everyone's ideal method of learning. This post was just some suggestions I had if you decided to read books to learn.
