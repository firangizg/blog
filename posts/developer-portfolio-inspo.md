Developer portfolios are extremely entertaining, inspirational and motivational to explore. I have been debating creating my own for a while, and have collected some inspiring developer portfolios that I came across online.

In no particular order, here are some portfolios that you can take inspiration from. Enjoy!

#1. Bruno Simon

[Bruno Simon has an extremely entertaining portfolio](https://bruno-simon.com/) website that you can explore for a while and forget the existence of time. *Honestly*. 

There is a car that you can use to move around and interact with the objects (play bowling or even use the honk).

#2. Robby Leonardi

[Robby has received many awards for his CSS art, and his portfolio](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/) website is an interactive resume. The gameified resume is very interesting to read through, and the illustrations are pretty.

#3. Matthew Farley

[Matt is a designer, front-end developer and a mentor. His portfolio](https://mattfarley.ca/) website is nicely designed, with beautiful illustrations. His experiences and previous work is presented in a nicely manner.

#4. Riccardo Zanutta

[Riccardo's portfolio has nice shapes that float around](http://riccardozanutta.com/) when you hover over them. His previous work is presented in slides and the website also has both light and dark mode available.

#5. SeÃ¡n Halpin

[SeÃ¡n's portfolio is minimalistic.](https://www.seanhalpin.design/) He includes his work in simple cards and the home page has a giant eye that looks around the page ðŸ‘€

#6. Rafael Caferati

[Rafael is a full-stack developer and his website](https://caferati.me/) is very interactive. A cool feature I noticed is the ability to filter off his projects based on the category of tech stack. You can also destroy the webpage after you have read it by playing a game and earning points like shown below.

#7. Jacek Jeznach

Jacek is a Front-End Developer. With the infamous TikTok logo as his initial, [the front page of the portfolio](https://jacekjeznach.com/) itself is amazing. When you hover above the letters in the introduction, letters bounce around. You can also enjoy a great music while exploring.
